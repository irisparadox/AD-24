# Design of Algorithms - Exercise Solutions ðŸ“˜ðŸ’»

Welcome to the repository containing **C++ exercise solutions** for the **Design of Algorithms** course at the **Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)**. Each exercise is implemented as a standalone **Visual Studio project**, using a mix of **Standard Template Library (STL) data structures** and **custom abstract data types (ADTs)** provided by the course instructors.

[!NOTE] This repository features solutions using both predefined C++ data structures (STL) and custom data types (TADs) created by the university professors.

## ðŸ“š About the Course

The **Design of Algorithms** course teaches students how to approach and solve algorithmic problems efficiently by applying both **standard data structures** and **custom TADs**. The course covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Queues** (FIFO, LIFO)
- **Priority Queues** (Heaps)
- **Graphs** (Adjacency lists/matrices)
- **Stacks**
- **Custom Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** designed for specific problems

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Data Structures**:
  - **STL**: Standard data structures like `std::queue`, `std::priority_queue`, `std::stack`, etc.
  - **Custom ADTs**: Provided by course professors for specific exercises.
- **Development Environment**: 
  - **Visual Studio** (each exercise is structured as a Visual Studio project)
  - Other compilers (GCC/MinGW) can also be used if adjusted, but Visual Studio is recommended for this repository.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a separate **exercise/project** and includes all the necessary files for compiling and running in **Visual Studio**. The code is organized into source files, with explanations on whether the **STL** or **custom TADs** are used.
